<p>
    Foldergallery_XH facilitates the presentation of image galleries on a
    CMSimple_XH website. Contrary to most other existing gallery plugins, the
    galleries are created completely automatically from existing images in a
    given folder, so that the galleries don't have to be prepared in the
    back-end. That makes Foldergallery_XH especially suited for large amounts of
    images, and also for use with <a

<h2>Important Notice</h2>
<p class="important">
    Foldergallery_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments. It is a
    so called beta version. Use with caution!
</p>
</section>

<section id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
    Foldergallery_XH requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.6.3, and PHP ≥
    5.4.0 with the GD and JSON extensions.
</p>
</section>

<section id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
    The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
    See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
    CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="important">
    Backup the data on your server.
</li>
<li>
    Unzip the distribution on your computer.
</li>
<li>
    Upload the whole directory foldergallery/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
    plugins directory.
</li>
<li>
    Set write permissions for the subdirectories cache/, config/, css/ and
    languages/.
</li>
<li class="important">
    Go to <em>Plugins</em>→<em>Foldergallery</em> in the back-end to check if
    all requirements are fulfilled.
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
    The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
    the website's back-end. Select <em>Plugins</em>→<em>Foldergallery</em>.
</p>
<p>
    You can change the default settings of Foldergallery_XH under
    <em>Config</em>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over
    the help icon with your mouse.
</p>
<p>
    Localization is done under <em>Language</em>. You can translate the character
    strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
    or customize them according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
    The look of Foldergallery_XH can be customized under <em>Stylesheet</em>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    Prepare the galleries by uploading images into CMSimple_XH's image folder,
    or a subfolder thereof, either via FTP or a filebrowser. The image captions
    shown by Foldergallery_XH are retrieved from the filename or, if available,
    the Exif <em>ImageDescription</em> tag stored in the image file.
</p>
<p>
    To present all images in the image folder on a page, insert the following
    plugin call:
</p>
<pre>{{{foldergallery}}}</pre>
<p>
    To present only the images of a subfolder (and all subfolders of that
    folder), use somethink like the following (replace
    <code>SUBFOLDERNAME</code> with the actual name of the subfolder):
</p>
<pre>{{{foldergallery 'SUBFOLDERNAME'}}}</pre>
</section>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    Currently, only a single gallery can be shown on each page.
</p>
<p>
    Only JPEG images are supported; other image formats are ignored.
</p>
<p>
    It takes some time to create the thumbnails, so many large images in the
    same folder may trigger a PHP timeout (CMSimple_XH reports a fatal error in
    this case). You may have to refresh your browser several times
    (<code>F5</code>), until all thumbnails have been created. To avoid that
    this happens to visitors of your website, it is recommended to have a look
    at the folder preview immediately after uploading a bunch of images.
